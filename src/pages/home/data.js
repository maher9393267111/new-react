When the sultan heard it, he admired the name and sent lots of gifts. Later the same sultan thought this name was a little dangerous for himself. He could fly but the sultan cant. Then they sent this adventurer to exile. The story says that he dies while he was in exile. Today, the tower serves as a museum for travelers who want to enjoy breathtaking views of the city. With the views of the old city Asian side, Bosphorus, and many more the place is a good spot for taking pictures. It also has a cafeteria that you can use after taking some pictures to rest. A visit to the Galata area without the tower is not complete. Dont miss it.",
